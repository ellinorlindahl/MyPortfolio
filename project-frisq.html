                <h3>Defining patient engagement</h3>
                <p>After researching and discussing the concept of patient engagement, we narrowed the definition down
                    to
                    these four key elements: <strong> understanding, empowerment, trust and security</strong>. We used
                    these key
                    words as baseline parameters throughout our research process, and used them when designing
                    qualitative
                    interview questions and quantitative questionnaires.</p>

                <h3>In-depth interviews + Thematic analysis</h3>

                <p>We conducted five in-depth interviews with people from our target user group. We then used our
                    transcriptions
                    to make a thematic analysis and found these four key insights:</p>

                <li>Human connection is important. The patients wants to be seen and heard by their health care
                    provider.
                </li>
                <li>Clear information exchange is important. The patient needs to comprehend all care instructions,
                    and
                    want their care providers to have a solid understanding of their medical history.</li>
                <li>Time is important. Patients felt like their care providers did not have enough time for them or
                    read
                    their journals, and they seldom met the same doctor consistently thoughout their care process.
                </li>
                <li>Coordination is important. Patients felt the lacking coordination between different health care
                    systems
                    created problems when trying to find the appropriate care for them, getting in touch with the
                    right
                    person or when there was a need to share information between departments or organisations.</li>

                <p>We also conducted five interviews with medical proffessionals: a nurse, a general practician, an
                    intensive
                    unit doctor, and two specialist doctors. These were our key take aways from those interviews:</p>
                <li>Too much time is spent on admin and documentation, due to poorly designed systems.</li>
                <li>Coordination and communication between health care units regarding a mutual patient is difficult.
                </li>
                <li>There is no overview anywhere of a patients medical history, only pages and pages of journals.</li>

        <h3>Ending words and recommendations</h3>
        <p>There is alot to be done to increase patient engagement, and our research suggests three key focus areas to
            FRISQ moving forward:</p>
        <li>Providing an overview of a patients medical history</li>
        <li>Aiding coordination and communication between health care units</li>
        <li>Improve the line of communication between patient and their care provider</li>
        <p>Rather than "creating yet another app" prompting patients to perform actions, we suggest FRISQ to work within
            the existing digital frameworks of the Swedish health care system.</p>
